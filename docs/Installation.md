# Installation

PakNet was made with the new luau type solver, so there will be type errors if you are not using it.  
The new type solver can be enabled from beta features for studio and in luau-lsp settings for external editors.

## Wally

Get the latest version of PakNet from [wally.run](https://wally.run/package/isoopod/paknet) and add it to your wally.toml

You will need to use [wally-package-types](https://crates.io/crates/wally-package-types) to fix the types

## Stand-alone

Download the latest PakNet.rbxm from [releases](https://github.com/isoopod/PakNet/releases) and insert it into ReplicatedStorage
